Final project

This is the final working version of our photography app submitted as a final project for CISC 4400: Mobile Programming.
We ran into complications in merging our various branches in git, so resorted to finishing the project locally,
and then uploading the finished code.

An APK is available for download on my website at [kennydurk.in/LetMeSee.apk](http://kennydurk.in/LetMeSee.apk).

In this app, we use background threading, HTTP communication, and JSON parsing in order to pass information and images
held on a database we created on a server to a structured view on the app.  The functionality is in place, but we haven't
fine tuned the UI/UX, or helped different activities communicate between each other, which would be our next step.

Overall, this project was a thorough exploration and understanding of the Android environment in general, and endowed us
with the basics on how to develop an application that could be of use to consumers.
